**LLM Model**

For my LLM of choice, I have used ChatGPT 5/4o and Qwen3 max. I have graciously used the LLMs to help me write the code for this project.

The first thing I did is I uploaded the original paper in chatGPT and went through section by section to understand the problem. One of my weakness is converting paper algorithms to code. I have fully capitalized chatgpt to act as a teacher and demonstrate how to convert algorithms from paper to code. Some of the example prompts I used are -

- "Explain this section with python example and visuale guide. Assume, I am a first year computer science student..."

- "Use the best practices of python to write this section of the algorithms. Add comments and docstrings as necessary..."

These were very helpful guides to start with, but the codes didn't compile off the bat. In order to debug the code, I have used github Co-pilot and Qwen. Even with LLM, it took me about 15 hours to sit and code through this assignment to get the result I wanted.

Having done this project, I can't reflect but think that programming is going to be obsolete in a conventional sense. Just like assembly language has been abstracted out (c, c++ and others) for mass reach and easier acces, regular programming is going to be abstracted away by these Large Language Models. Programming is going to become more conversational. A good programmer still needs to know the fundamental of programming to be good at the task at hand, but LLM is going to abstract away a lot of the concepts that people wont even have to think of, for example - OOP, different anti-patterns, and commenting.
