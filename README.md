Bengio et al. introduced the concept of embedding each word in a feature vector to overcome the issue of semantics and very large sparse matrix computation issue. This feature vector projects words into a higher dimension. The weights of the vectors are learned as a result, words similar in nature lie closer to each other in higher dimension.
